### Problem Statement:
Amazon Academy has launched a new course on Quantum Physics. The course consists of `n` chapters, and each chapter has `memory[i]` memory points, which a student gains or loses while reading that chapter.

- To study the `i-th` chapter, the student must revisit all the previous chapters. 
- The student gains `memory[0] + memory[1] + ... + memory[i]` memory points for reading the `i-th` chapter. 
- The total memory points is the sum of memory points gained while reading each chapter.

Students can read the chapters in any order, and they want to maximize their total memory points. Find the maximum total memory points a student can score, ensuring that all the chapters are read.

### Example:
**Input**:  
`memory = [3, 4, 5]`

Considering all permutations of reading the chapters and their corresponding memory points:

- `[3, 4, 5]`: Memory points = `[3, 7, 12]`, Total = `3 + 7 + 12 = 21`
- `[3, 5, 4]`: Memory points = `[3, 8, 12]`, Total = `3 + 8 + 12 = 23`
- `[5, 4, 3]`: Memory points = `[5, 9, 12]`, Total = `5 + 9 + 12 = 26`

The maximum total memory points is `26`.

### Function Signature:
```java
long maximizeTotalMemoryPoints(List<Integer> memory)
```

### Constraints:
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`
- `-10^3 ≤ memory[i] ≤ 10^3`

### Input Format:
- The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of chapters.
- The second line contains `n` integers representing `memory[]`.

### Output:
- Return a long integer: the maximum possible total memory points.

### Sample Input:
``` 
3
1 2 -2
```

### Sample Output:
```
9
```

### Solution:

The idea to solve this problem is that the best way to maximize total memory points is to sort the memory points in descending order. This way, the largest chapters contribute the most to the cumulative sum.

Here is the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static long maximizeTotalMemoryPoints(List<Integer> memory) {
        // Sort memory in descending order to maximize the cumulative sum
        Collections.sort(memory, Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        long totalMemoryPoints = 0;
        long cumulativeSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate total memory points
        for (int mem : memory) {
            cumulativeSum += mem;
            totalMemoryPoints += cumulativeSum;
        }
        
        return totalMemoryPoints;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        List<Integer> memory = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            memory.add(scanner.nextInt());
        }
        
        long result = maximizeTotalMemoryPoints(memory);
        System.out.println(result);
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: The chapters should be read in decreasing order of memory points to maximize the cumulative sum.
2. **Cumulative sum**: We calculate the sum of memory points for each chapter and keep a running total of these sums.
3. **Time complexity**: Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`, and the cumulative sum computation takes `O(n)`, making this solution efficient for large inputs.

### Example Walkthrough:

For `memory = [3, 4, 5]`:
- Sort in descending order: `[5, 4, 3]`
- Cumulative sums: `[5, 9, 12]`
- Total memory points: `5 + 9 + 12 = 26`.

Thus, the output is `26`.
